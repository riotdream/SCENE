   These docs are provided to you in respect that you know the basics of your
   operating system, being Linux, FreeBSD, ... If you come in #glftpd without
   reading these docs or without sufficient knowledge of your OS, then you WILL
   get flamed and this is your own fault. We do not have enough time to support
   glFTPd AND your OS. Be smart and learn about your OS first... it helps a lot.

   This document describes how to install, and covers some frequently asked
   questions and answers regarding the glFTPd server. They are compiled from
   various sources including the old glFTPd Forum (now deprecated) and the
   glftpd IRC channel on EFnet (#glftpd).

   The latest version of this document can always be found at
   https://www.glftpd.eu.

   Please read the changelog and faq as well as looking at this document.

   If you have a suggestion or correction, please feel free to let us know.

 PREREQUISITES:
 --------------
   You need the following to successfully install and use glFTPd:
     -root password
     -System V ipc support in kernel (shared memory)
     -Disk drive with UNIX-like file system (like ext3/ext4 in Linux)
     -At least 30MB of free space, more is recommended for logs, users, ...


 SETUP:
 ------
   The installgl.sh file is an install script that eliminates all of the
   following steps. It is recommended to try this first before attempting to
   do all the steps by hand.
   If running this script more than once returns an error, please do the
   following to clear any of it's changes and start over again:
     -remove all glftpd references from /etc/inetd.conf, /etc/services
     -rm -rf /glftpd /etc/glftpd.conf
   Change installpaths and inetd conf according to your settings.

   The installation instructions are provided for the Linux OS, though they'll
   work with minor adjustments for other OS's too. The above-mentioned installer
   script handles other OS's like FreeBSD as well.

1. Extract the archive in the current directory:
	tar -zxf glftpd-XXX-x.xx_xxxx.tgz

2. Create a directory where you want to install glFTPd:
	mkdir /glftpd

3. Copy glFTPd's files to the installation directory and create needed dirs:
	cd glftpd-XXX-x.xx_xxxx
	cp -pr bin docs etc ftp-data gcp sitebot glftpd.conf /glftpd/
	mkdir /glftpd/{dev,site,ftp-data/msgs}


   Steps 4-7 are only needed for scripts, like zipscript, to work and are not
   necessary for glFTPd itself. These are also not needed if you installed
   glFTPd in "/" instead of it's own directory like "/glftpd".

4. Copy extra needed bins:
	cd /glftpd/bin/
	cp /bin/sh /bin/cat /bin/grep /bin/egrep /bin/unzip /bin/wc /bin/find
	 /bin/ls /bin/bash /bin/mkdir /bin/rmdir /bin/rm /bin/mv /bin/cp /bin/ls
	 /bin/awk /bin/basename /bin/dirname /bin/head /bin/tail /bin/cut
	 /bin/tr /bin/sed /bin/date /bin/sleep /bin/touch /bin/gzip /bin/zip .

   Make sure all permissions are set correctly in "/glftpd/bin" and that your
   incoming directory is world-wide-read/writeable:
	chmod -R 755 /glftpd/bin
	chmod -R 755 /glftpd/lib
	chmod 777 /glftpd/site/incoming

5. Copy the required library files and the "ldconfig" util to your
   installation directory:
	cd /glftpd
	ldd bin/* and cp each of the necessary libs to their corresponding
	libdirs in /glftpd/
	cp /sbin/ldconfig bin/

   The provided libcopy.sh can automatically copy the needed libs.

6. Create device nodes:
	cd /glftpd/dev
	mknod null c 1 3; chmod 666 null
	mknod zero c 1 5; chmod 666 zero
	mknod full c 1 7; chmod 666 full
	mknod urandom c 1 9; chmod 666 urandom

   Other OS's may have a different syntax, see "ls -l /dev/*" for nodenumbers.

   FreeBSD 6.0 (and up) does no longer support the usage of mknod to create
   devicenodes. Instead you have to use devfs:
   Add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:
	devfs_set_rulesets="/glftpd/dev/=devfsrules_glftpd"
   Add the following line to /etc/fstab:
	none /glftpd/dev devfs rw 0 0
   Add the following lines to /etc/devfs.rules (create the file if necessary):
	[devfsrules_glftpd=230]
	add include $devfsrules_hide_all
	add include $devfsrules_unhide_basic
   To make the changes take effect w/o rebooting, run:
	mount_devfs devfs /glftpd/dev
	/etc/rc.d/devfs start

7. Create "ld.so.cache" in your ftp-structure:
	chroot /glftpd /bin/ldconfig

   If this doesn't work, try:
	chroot /glftpd /bin/ldconfig /lib

   Other OS's might use other files, see "man ldconfig" and check what it
   creates, then create that directory in your installation directory before
   performing this step.

   You might need to create "/glftpd/etc/ld.so.conf" and put "/lib" inside.

   You will probably get an error-message like this, just ignore it:
   "bin/ldconfig: warning: can't open /usr/lib (No such file or directory),
   skipping"
   Ignore other errors that mention missing files or symlinks.

   Check that "/glftpd/etc/ld.so.cache" (or similar on your OS) exists, if not
   go back to step 5 and try again.

8. Copy the config file to "/etc" and edit it to your likes:
	cp /glftpd/glftpd.conf /etc/glftpd.conf

   DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE ON WINDOWS!

   Info regarding the settings can be found further below.

   VERY IMPORTANT: glftpd.conf is your server configuration file. You MUST edit
   this!!!! READ everything in this file and the explanations in this doc, it
   has many variables that are easy to follow.

9. GlFTPd needs to be run from an inet-daemon, for openbsd-inetd this is done
   by adding the following line in "/etc/inetd.conf":
	glftpd stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /glftpd/bin/glftpd -l -o -i
   or if not using tcpd (with "glftpd" as bogus flag):
	glftpd stream tcp nowait root /glftpd/bin/glftpd glftpd -l -o -i
   Change "tcp" to "tcp6" to use IPv6, if you still want IPv4 connectivity, then
   duplicate the line and have one with "tcp6" and the other with "tcp4".
   When using inetutils-inetd, "tcp6" should provide IPv4 connectivity as well.

   Add the following line to "/etc/services":
	glftpd	<Port you want glftpd on>/tcp
   Example: glftpd 8000/tcp # Glftpd

   Do not initially put your ftpd on port 21... stick it on a port > 1024 so you
   know it works. Also do not put it right next to another, but leave 5-10 ports
   inbetween.

   The installer script supports rlinetd, xinetd and systemd as well, see their
   manpages or README.xinetd and README.systemd.

   If you ARE using tcpd, make sure you modify hosts.allow to allow connections
   to glFTPd (something like GLFTPD: ALL)

   The following switches can be used on the commandline:
   -B		This will only allow connections from the port bouncer
		(connecting from localhost [127.0.0.1] will still work).
   -b		This allows connections from a port bouncer or directly.
   -d, -v	Logs connections to system logs (usually "/var/log/syslog", but
		refer to your "/etc/syslog.conf") and all user commands to
		"rootpath/datapath/logs/error.log".
   -e		This will use European week (Mon-Sun) when modifying stats.
   -i		Logs uploads to "rootpath/datapath/logs/xferlog".
   -I <#>	Timeout in seconds for an ident-lookup, 0 disables ident
		lookups. Note that if you use tcpd, it will do an ident lookup
		independently from glFTPd.
   -l		Logs DELDIR, NEWDIR, NUKE, REQUEST, REQFILLED, TAGLINE, UNNUKE,
		WIPE and WIPE-r to "rootpath/datapath/logs/glftpd.log" and
		LOGIN, LOGOUT and TIMEOUT to "rootpath/datapath/logs/login.log"
		in ASCII.
   -L		Works just like -l, but it will always log creation and deletion
		of directories to glftpd.log. The -l option only logs those if
		they are in dirlog path (specified in glftpd.conf).
		Most likely, you want to use -l, this is for special cases.
   -n <#>	Number of DNS retries, 0 disables DNS resolving.
   -o		Logs downloads to "rootpath/datapath/logs/xferlog".
   -r<filepath>	Full path to "glftpd.conf" if not using the default in "/etc/".
		Example: -r/home/glftpd/etc/glftpd.conf
   -s<filepath>	Full path to glstrings.bin if not using the default in
		"/glftpd/bin/".
		Example: -s/home/glftpd/bin/myownglstrings.bin
   -t <#>	Sets the default idle timeout period in seconds.
   -T <#>	Sets the maximum idle timeout period in seconds a user may select
		using the 'site idle' command when the user has no idle time set
		('site change user idle_time <#>').
   -x		Makes glFTPd only log IP's on errors (by default everything will
		be logged).
   -X		Forces glftpd not to log IP's (not even errors in "login.log").

10. Restart the inet-daemon:
	service openbsd-inetd restart

   This is only needed when modifying "inetd.conf", "glftpd.conf" has nothing to
   do with inetd. For changes in "glftpd.conf" to take effect, you need to
   relogin.

11. Create a certificate with the create_server_key.sh script and point to it
   in your "glftpd.conf", see further below for more related options.

12. Login to your newly created site with Login/Pass = glftpd/glftpd.
   Initially only logins from localhost are possible as this default account is
   locked to logins from localhost. Also use an ftp-client capable of TLS.
	ftp localhost <Port you have chosen>

   For SECURITY reasons you will either need to DELETE this account or change
   the IP and password.

   If you get a "421 Service not available" message or something similar, you
   didn't install glFTPd correctly. Check your system logs (you might need to
   configure your syslog to start logging errors and warnings, see
   'man syslog.conf'), glftpd logs, permissions, config file settings, and try
   installing again.

13. Now add your own account and enable the siteop flag:
	site adduser <user> <password> <ident@ip>
	site change <user> flags +1

   The 1 flag is NOT god mode... you must add any flags you wish to perform,
   those flags are listed later in this doc.

14. Set up a crontab entry for root to run the included "reset" bin every
   night at midnight.
	0 0 * * *	/glftpd/bin/reset

   Reset is a binary that resets users' daily/weekly/monthly
   upload/download/nuke statistics. Try reset -h for help. You do not normally
   need any arguments, reset will make it's own decision on what to reset based
   on the system date. If you use switches to reset specific stats, this
   automated resetting will not kick in.

15. Log rotation won't be covered here - you should know how to do that.
   However, there are 2 utils that you should regularly use to keep your dirlog
   in shape (list of directories on site).
	-glupdate, to re-add moved directories to dirlog, or to add new
	  directories that were not created through glftpd.
	-olddirclean2, to remove old entries from your dirlog (when you
	  move/delete directories) and to sort your dirlog after glupdate runs.
   For more info, look in "/glftpd/bin/sources".

 `----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

,------------.
| A. Settings |
`------------'

   All the settingnames are case-insensitive, and can be placed anywhere in the
   file, as long as the order for same-named settings is maintained for those
   where it matters. Paths and filenames are of course case-sensitive.

   The arguments for the settings follow this format:
   - if between <>, then it is mandatory
   - if between [], then it is optional
   - ... after an argument means it can be used again
   - if |, then one can choose between the left and right value
   - a -, +, !, *, {, } or digit are literally those symbols
   - #: any integral number, can have restrictions
   - X and Y: two different numbers or symbols
   - string: any non-zero sequence of symbols excluding space
   - stringlist: multiple strings divided by spaces
   - path: an absolute path
   - pathmask: an absolute path with masking symbols
   - dir: a directoryname, has no '/'
   - dirmask: a dir with masking symbols
   - file: a filename
   - filemask: a file with masking symbols
   - filepath: an absolute path to a file
   - filepathmask: a filepath with masking symbols
   - IP: an IP address
   - IPmask: an IP address with masking symbols
   - hostname: a string resolvable to an IP address
   - hostmask: a hostname with masking symbols
   - user: a username
   - flag: a flag a user can have
   - group: a groupname
   - permission: flag|-user|=group|*

 SPECIAL SYMBOLS:
 ----------------
	* If you want to use a space in an argument, you need to use [:space:]
	instead. Glftpd will convert it to ' '.

	* When glftpd sees the character #, it will replace it with null
	(meaning everything that follows it will be disregarded). All comments
	should be done this way.

	* To represent the # character, use [:hash:].

	* For the settings where a mask is used, the following can be used:
	 - ?: to match a single symbol
	 - *: to match zero or more symbols
	 - [X-Y]: to match a single symbol within the given range


 SETTING SETTINGS:
 -----------------
ifip IPmask [IPmask ...]
elseip
endifip
	Settings in glftpd.conf can be conditional - depending on the IP mask
	of the user connecting. The "ifip" setting takes one or more IP	masks.
	If the connecting IP matches one of those masks, settings that follow
	(on lines below) will be used, until "elseip" or "endifip" is
	encountered. If the IP does not match any of the masks, settings that
	follow it will be ignored. If "elseip" is encountered, settings that
	follow it will be used instead.

	Nesting in the elseip part is ok, but it's not recommended to nest in
	the if part, it might screw up.

	Examples: this was mainly created for the pasv_addr setting, so that
	users connecting locally could have a different pasv_addr than those
	connecting from the Internet, but it can be used with all settings:

	ifip 192.168.* 10.*
	  pasv_addr 10.10.10.1
	  sitename_long MyLanSite
	elseip
	  ifip 127.0.0.1
	    include /glftpd/etc/myspeciallocalsettings.conf
	  elseip
	    pasv_addr 128.1.2.3 1
	    sitename_long MyInternetSite
	  endifip
	endifip

include	<filepath>
	You can use "include" to split the main config file into several
	pieces, kind of like it's done in C (but without the # in front).
	Just add a line "include /path/to/config.file" to glftpd.conf.


 TLS SETTINGS:
 -------------
allowed_protocols <stringlist>
	Put here the TLS protocols that are allowed to be used by clients.
	Possible options are TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and/or TLSv1.2.
	By default only TLSv1.2 is allowed.

cert_file <filepath>
	The path to your certificate to be used for TLS mode. This can be a
	certificate generated by RSA, DSA (unusable when DSS is disabled in
	the ciphers_* settings below) or ECDSA (recommended).
	Default location used is "/glftpd/ftpd.pem".

ciphers_for_ctrl <string>
	Here you can define which ciphers glftpd can use (and not use) and the
	order of preference to encrypt the control channel with a client. These
	can be explicit names like "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384" or groups
	like "HIGH+EDH". See "openssl ciphers -v" for explicit names.
	See the "cipher list format" and "cipher strings" sections in openssl's
	manual ("man ciphers") for usable ciphers and groups and format to use.
	Default used is "HIGH+EECDH:HIGH+EDH:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS".

ciphers_for_data <string>
	Here you can define which ciphers glftpd can use (and not use) and the
	order of preference to encrypt transfers over the data channel with a
	client. See "ciphers_for_ctrl" for usage and default.

ciphers_for_dir <string>
	Here you can define which ciphers glftpd can use (and not use) and the
	order of preference to encrypt dirlistings over the data channel with a
	client. See "ciphers_for_ctrl" for usage and default.

dhparam_file <filepath>
	If you want to use your own DH parameters, you can provide these here.

dsa_cert_file <filepath>
	Same as "cert_file" but kept for backwards compatibility.
	Used if no "rsa_cert_file" and "cert_file" settings exist.

ecdhe_curves <string>
	You can specify other ECDHE curves in order of fallback than the default
	used "P-521:P-384:P-256" or equivalent "secp521r1:secp384r1:secp256k1",
	in case your openssl lib does not provide it or you want to use a faster
	(but possibly less secure) curve.
	See "openssl ecparam -list_curves" for usable curves.

rsa_cert_file <filepath>
	Same as "cert_file" but kept for backwards compatibility.
	Used if no "cert_file" setting exists.

tls_ftps <0|1>
	Setting this to 1 enables FTPS mode which uses TLS from the start of the
	connection, except for connections coming from a bouncer which must run
	the IDNT command first. This should not be used for a regular ftp server.
	Default 0.

tls_ops <stringlist>
	The options that you set here are used to change the protocol behaviour
	of the SSL library. See "man SSL_CTX_set_options" and the openssl/ssl.h
	header file located on your system for the options that you can use.
	In the header file, the options all start with SSL_OP_.

	Do not use the MACRO names as argument, but the hexnumbers found in the
	header file, OR'd together. See the default as example.

	Default used is SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION | SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE |
	SSL_OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE | SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE, which is
	0x00020000L | 0x00100000L | 0x00080000L | 0x00400000L which can be used
	as argument, and which is 0x005A0000L and can be used as argument too.

	The SSL_OP_NO_SSL* options are always added to this variable so don't
	need to be added here, and the SSL_OP_NO_TLS* options are controlled
	through the allowed_protocols setting.


 SECURITY SETTINGS:
 ------------------
banned_users <user> [user ...]
	List of usernames that can't be used for new users.

	If present, file "/rootpath/datapath/help/site.adduser.banned" will be
        displayed when someone attempts to add such a user.

	Example: banned_users root billgates
	The usernames "root" and "billgates" will be denied to be used.

denydatauncrypted  [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	You can deny unencrypted transfers for certain users/groups/flags or
	deny for everyone and only allow certain users/groups/flags.

	Example: denydatauncrypted !-idiot !=IDIOTS *
	Only user idiot and group IDIOTS can transfer files unencrypted.

denydiruncrypted  [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Same as denydatauncrypted but for dirlistings over the data channel.

noretrieve <filename> [filename ...]
	Specifies files that cannot be downloaded.
	Password files and other sensitive files should be listed here.

	Multiple lines allowed, each max 50 filenames.

path-filter <group> [filepath string [string ...]]
	Sets rules for which directory and filenames are allowed and which are
	denied and for which groups these rules apply. The default is to allow
	anything for anyone, but this is a security risk and not recommended.
	The filters are applied both on creation and renaming.

	The second argument should point to a file that will be displayed when a
	file or dir isn't allowed. Use a non-existent file to display nothing.
	When a second argument is specified, a third is mandatory. This string
	is a filter which only allows the files matching it. The fourth and
	following arguments are filters that deny files matching them.

	The filters are regular expressions - see 'man re_format' to learn more
	about these rules. Max 47 denyfilters are allowed.

	You can use multiple path-filter lines. The first group match wins, so
	the line with * in the group field should always be last.

	Example: path-filter * none ^[-A-Za-z0-9_.()[:space:]]*$ ^\. ^-
	This allows only filenames made up of the symbols A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "._-()"
	and spaces, and they may not start with "." or "-". No message is shown,
	unless if a file $ROOTPATH/none would exist.

	Example: path-filter * none ^[][[:alnum:]_.'()[:space:]-]*$ ^\. ^-
	This is the same as above, except now "[" and "]" are allowed too.

	Example: path-filter MUSiC /ftp-data/misc/pathmsg ^.*\.[Mm][Pp]3$
	This will allow the MUSiC group to only create and rename to files and
	directories ending in ".MP3", ".Mp3" or ".mp3".

secure_ip <0-4[:0-8]> <#[:#]> <0|1> <0|1> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Glftpd will not allow an IP, IPmask or hostname to be added that doesn't
	pass these rules. By default no rules are applied.

	The first argument specifies the minimum number of fully numeric fields
	that need to be in the IP address. A distinction can be made for IPv4
	and IPv6 addresses by using a ':' as splitter. The first part will be
	used for IPv4, the second part for IPv6. If no ':' is present, the
	amount for IPv6 used will be the amount for IPv4 times 2 (as there are
	double the amount of fields).

	The second argument specifies the minimum number of bits a CIDR IPmask
	must have. This ranges from 0 to 32. A distinction can be made for IPv4
	and IPv6 addresses by using a ':' as splitter. The first part will be
	used for IPv4, the second part for IPv6. If no ':' is present, the
	amount for IPv6 used will be the amount for IPv4 times 4 (as there are
	4 times the amount of bits).

	The third argument, if set to 1, allows hostnames.

	The fourth argument, if set to 1, will require a valid ident for the IP.

	You can have several secure_ip entries; glftpd will go through all of
	them. If a match for the user adding the IP is found in the flags,
	users and groups on the right, and the security settings allow the IP,
	the search will stop. Otherwise, glftpd will continue until either
	another rule allows the IP or there are no more rules. In the second
	case, if there were any rules that matched the user but denied the IP,
	the IP will be denied, otherwise it will be allowed.

	Example: secure_ip 2 16 1 0 =STAFF 1
	This will allow STAFF and siteops to add numeric IP's with 2 or more
	fully numeric fields, 16 or more CIDR bits and let them add hostnames,
	as in a@b.com. A valid ident will not be required.

	Example: secure_ip 3 24 0 1 *
	This will allow everyone else to add IP's with 3 or more fully-numeric
	fields or equivalent 24 or more CIDR bits and it will not allow anyone
	to add hostnames. A valid ident will be required.

secure_pass <string> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Glftpd will not allow passwords that do not follow these rules.
	By default no rules are applied.

	The string's length sets the minimum password length. You can also
	specify the minimum number of capital and lowercase letters, digits and
	"other symbols".

	The '.' is a placeholder to "fill in" to the minimum length you want.

	You can use any (capital) letter, digit, or "other symbol" (except '.')
	in the mask.

	You can have several secure_pass entries; glftpd will go through all of
	them. If a match for the user changing the pass is found in the flags,
	users and groups on the right, and the security settings allow the pass,
	the search will stop. Otherwise, glftpd will continue until either
	another rule allows the pass or there are no more rules. In the second
	case, if there were any rules that matched the user but denied the pass,
	the pass will be denied, otherwise it will be allowed.

	Example: secure_pass Ab1... *
	This will only allow passwords 6 characters or longer that contain at
	least one capital letter, one lowercase letter and one digit.
	Everyone who changes a password (through either "site passwd" or
	"site chpass" will have to stick to this mask.

	Example: secure_pass ZZf3$. !1 !=STAFF *
	This will force everyone but siteops and members of STAFF to have
	passwords at least 6 characters long, with at least 2 capital letters,
	one lowercase letter, one digit, and one "other symbol".

userrejectinsecure [!]<-user|*> [[!]-user|* ...]
	This forces TLS mode for certain users or for everyone except some.
	You cannot use =group or flag as the userfile isn't loaded yet.

	Example: userrejectinsecure !-hoe *
	Only user hoe is not forced to use TLS mode.

userrejectsecure [!]<-user|*> [[!]-user|* ...]
	This denies TLS mode for certain users or for all users except some.
	You cannot use =group or flag as the userfile isn't loaded yet.

	Example: userrejectsecure -lamer !*
	Only user lamer is denied to use TLS mode.


 PRIVACY SETTINGS:
 -----------------
hidden_files <path> <filemask> [filemask ...]
	Specifies masks for files, directories, links, etc that will be skipped
	during directory listing below the given path, even if the -a or -A
	switch is used to show standard hidden files (starting with ".").

	Multiple lines are allowed, even with same paths; each line can have max
	49 filemasks.

	Example: hidden_files / .message hidden.*

hide_user_or_group <#|"no"> <#|"no"> <path> [path ...]
	This will make glftpd show fake username and/or groupname for directories
	and files, instead of the real username and/or groupname, when a user does
	a "LIST".

	The first argument is for the UID, the second for the GID.

	The third argument should be the path for which this option will work.
	You may specify several paths. No wildcards. You don't even need full
	paths, instead of /site you can use /si and it will work for /site as
	well as every other directory starting with /si, and every subdirectory
	of that directory.

	Example: hide_user_or_group 0 1000 /site/archive/remote/
	This will show the username belonging to UID 0 and groupname belonging
	to GID 1000 for all directories and files in "/site/archive/remote/".

	Example: hide_user_or_group 2300 no /site/archive /site/remote
	This will show the username belonging to UID 2300 and the original
	groupname for every directory that begins with "/site/archive" or
	"/site/remote",	like /site/archive/whatever, /site/remote1, etc.

hideuser [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Allows you to hide users from being displayed in site who, added to the
	last-users-online file, or listed with "site users".

	Example: hideuser -Usurper =HIDDENGROUP 1 7 =LEECH
	This will hide all users with siteop or useredit flags, all members of
	HIDDENGROUP or LEECH and user Usurper.

	Note: this setting does not affect siteops - they can see all.

	If you want to hide users from stat commands, you need to chown their
	userfiles to 99:99.

privgroup <group> [string]
	Here you define a private group and an optional description.

	Example: privgroup STAFF Siteops[:space:]And[:space:]Such

privpath <path> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Here it is specified who gets access to certain directories.
	Users that do not match the permissions will not see the directory.
	First path-match stops the search, so deepest path first.
	Special variables "[:username:]" and "[:groupname:]" replace current
	user's username and primary groupname, respectively.

	Note: no wildcards allowed in the path, this would slow down directory
	listings too much.


 LOCATION SETTINGS:
 ------------------
datapath <path>
	The path where you keep all data-files, relative to your rootpath.
	The default used is "/ftp-data".

	If your rootpath is "/", this would be "/glftpd/ftp-data".

grp_path <filepath>
	The path where you want glftpd's group file stored, relative to your
	rootpath. The default is "/etc/group".

	If your rootpath is "/", this would be "/glftpd/etc/group", otherwise
	you would be using the system's group file which is incompatible.

min_homedir <path>
	You need this set to allow siteops to change users' home directories
	with "site change". Path should be relative to rootpath.

	Example: min_homedir /site
	This will allow homedir to be inside the /site dir but not outside.

	Note: This setting has nothing to do with the actual users' homedirs,
	it is a simple security setting to stop siteops from allowing people to
	start in protected directories. To change actual homedirs, either edit
	/glftpd/etc/passwd for existing users, or modify the HOMEDIR line in
	/glftpd/ftp-data/users/default.* for new users.

pwd_path <filepath>
	The path where you want glftpd's passwd file stored, relative to your
	rootpath. The default is "/etc/passwd".

	If your rootpath is "/", this would be "/glftpd/etc/passwd", otherwise
	you would be using the system's passwd file which is incompatible.

reload_config <filepath>
	The config file used when we receive a SIGHUP signal.

	Glftpd will reload the config file when it receives the SIGHUP signal.
	This will only happen if there is a reload_config line in the config
	file. The path specified is relative to the rootpath and to make this
	work the file must be within the rootpath.

	Note: when a bad config path is specified and glftpd gets a SIGHUP
	signal, all users will be logged out with an error telling it's
	impossible to read the config file.

rootpath <path>
	The path where all your system directories reside. (bin, etc, lib...)

	Glftpd will chroot to this directory when a user connects, meaning
	nothing above this directory can be accessed through ftp. If no path
	is specified, glftpd will assume /glftpd as its rootpath.


 SCRIPT SETTINGS:
 ----------------
	The following environment variables can be used by external scripts:
	  $USER		Username.
	  $FLAGS	User's flags.
	  $TAGLINE	User's tagline.
	  $GROUP	User's primary group.
	  $RATIO	User's main ratio.
	  $PGROUP	User's first private group.
	  $SPEED	Speed in KiB/s, updated after every upload/download.
	  $HOST		User's ident@ip.
	  $HOME		User's home directory (from /glftpd/etc/passwd).
	  $SECTION	The name of the section user is currently in.

botscript_path <filepath>
	The path to your bot script, default "/bin/botscript".

	The botscript will be executed after a directory is created, deleted,
	nuked or unnuked.
	You can use it to signal your bot to 'announce' those events.

cscript <string> <"pre"|"post"> <filepath>
	CScript is short for Custom Script. This is a custom script (or binary)
	to be executed before or after any command. Multiple lines allowed,
	but every command can only have one "pre" and one "post".

	The first argument is the name of the command, the second if this is
	before ("pre") or after ("post") the command execution and the third
	is the script or binary to execute.

	If using a command with a space in it, like a site command, you need to
	use "[:space:]" between the words, e.g. site[:space:]who.

	CScripts for "pre" mode are run without checking the permissions of the
	command they are executed before.

	CScripts run in "post" mode won't be able to echo anything to the client
	because they are executed after glftpd sends the response to the client;
	output to a logfile is however still possible.

	If a CScript in "pre" mode exits with anything bigger than 0 (or if it
	can't be executed), then the command which should run after the CScript
	will NOT be executed, neither the command's "post" CScript.

	Some "post" scripts will not be executed when the command they follow
	fails (for example, if you try to add a user, but have no access to the
	'site adduser' command).
	A list of commands that behave this way:
	 APPE, CDUP, CPSV, CWD, DELE, MKD, MODE, PASV, RETR, RMD, RNFR, RNTO,
	 SSCN, STOR, STOU, STRU, TYPE, XCUP, XCWD, XMKD, XRMD.
	and SITE commands:
	 ADDUSER, CHANGE, DELUSER, GADDUSER, GRPADD, GRPCHANGE, GRPDEL, GRPREN,
	 KICK, KILL, NUKE, ONEL, READD, RENUSER, REQFILLED, REQUEST, UNNUKE,
	 WIPE.
	This list might grow in the future upon funded request.

	It is YOUR responsibility to send the correct MESSAGE CODE with every
	line sent to the client; if a wrong code is used, ftp clients may
	'hang'. To find out what code you need to use, just look at what glftpd
	uses when that command is executed.
        Example: if you run a script before "site who", and you want to print
        something from it, use: printf "200Your message here\r".

	If you exit a pre script with 1 in order to prevent the user from
	executing the command, you might want to use a generic error code with
	your sent lines, like 500, which will tell the clients that this command
	was denied - or use the error code that glftpd uses when denying
	execution of this command.

	Both kind of scripts will be passed 3 parameters:
	  $1 = full command string the user used.
	  $2 = user's login name.
	  $3 = user's primary non-private group.

	Example: cscript site[:space:]who pre /bin/sitewhoprescript.sh
		 cscript retr post /bin/postdownloadscript.sh

max_sitecmd_lines <#>
	Specifies the maximum number of output lines from a custom site command
	that are shown to users. Default is 9999.

post_check <filepath> [pathmask]
	Also called zipscript, this executes the first argument, which is
	relative to the rootpath, AFTER an upload finishes.
	See example /glftpd/bin/zipscript.

	See "pre_check" for pathmask info and echoing.

	Example:
	post_check none /site/public/*	# disables zipscript in /site/public
	post_check /bin/special.sh /site/special/*	# special zipscript
	post_check /bin/zipscript	# normal zipscript for all other paths

	If you want to enable upload resume in a certain path, you should
	disable the zipscript for that path, so that partial files are not
	deleted when the uploader loses connection.

	The post_check script receives 3 parameters from glftpd:
	$1 - the name of the uploaded file
	$2 - the directory the file was uploaded to
	$3 - the CRC code of the file (with calc_crc enabled, else 00000000)
	     Note: if the uploader times out, the CRC code is 00000000 as well,
	     this to prevent that if one reconnected and started uploading the
	     same file again but left a stalled upload session alive, a bad crc
	     would be passed and the file would be deleted.

	Exit with 1 or 127 to indicate a problem with the execution of the
	script, exit with anything else besides 0 to have the file deleted.
	The user's credits and stats will not be added and the file will be
	removed from the dupe database.
	Exit with a number between 10 and 1010 to have glftpd "sleep" that many
	seconds minus 10 before continuing. This might be helpful to prevent
	users uploading a bad file over and over until it is complete on source.
	Example: a user waits 10 seconds after a bad file upload with "exit 20".
	Note: exit code 127 is exempted; it will NOT cause a delay and is
	treated like exit code 1 instead.

pre_check <filepath> [pathmask]
	Also called dupescript, this executes the first argument, which is
	relative to the rootpath, BEFORE an upload begins.
	See example /glftpd/bin/dupescript.

	Multiple lines can be used, first pathmask match stops the search. No
	pathmask present is the same as *. If you want to have multiple scripts
	executed in the same path, you must use a wrapper.

	The pre_check script receives 2 parameters from glftpd:
	$1 - the name of the file to be uploaded
	$2 - the directory the file will be uploaded to

	You should only echo normal text if the exit code that follows it will
	be > 0 (meaning the file upload will be rejected). If you want to echo
	something and then exit with 0, you have to put "#0" at the beginning
	of the echo string. Example: echo "#0File will be accepted!".

	Exit with 1 or 127 to indicate a problem with the execution of the
	script, exit with anything else besides 0 to deny the upload.

pre_del_check <filepath> [pathmask]
	Also called delscript, this executes the first argument, which is
	relative to the rootpath, BEFORE a directory or file is deleted.
	See example /glftpd/bin/delscript.

	See "pre_check" for pathmask info, parameters, echoing and exitcodes.

pre_dir_check <filepath> [pathmask]
	Also called dirscript, this executes the first argument, which is
	relative to the rootpath, BEFORE a directory is created.
	See example /glftpd/bin/dirscript.

	See "pre_check" for pathmask info, parameters, echoing and exitcodes.

site_cmd <string> <"exec"|"text"|"is"> <filepath> [string]
custom-<string> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	New "site" commands are specified with this setting.
	The "custom" and "site_cmd" settings always need to be specified
	together, with "string" being the same. They however do not have to
	be specified on successive lines on the conf.

	The first argument will be the command after the "site ".

	The second argument can be:
	  EXEC: execute the third argument (and optional fourth).
	  TEXT: display the third argument, converting cookies to their values.
	  IS: execute the third argument which is an internal command.

	Example: site_cmd upurge exec /bin/upurge.sh
		 custom-upurge 1 =STAFF
		 site_cmd rules text /ftp-data/misc/site.rules
		 custom-rules *
		 site_cmd picture text /ftp-data/misc/picture.asc
		 site_cmd weektop is wkup
		 custom-picture =STAFF -Usurper 1 7
		 custom-weektop !8 *

	Be aware that commands defined in "is" mode are subject to 2 sets of
	restrictions: first, the custom-* setting, and then the permissions
	for the internal command.
	For "weektop" above in the example this would be "-stats".

	If using the "exec" mode, an optional argument can be used that will be
	passed to the program in front of any user arguments. To specify
	multiple arguments, use [:space:].

	Example: site_cmd TEST EXEC /bin/test.sh arg1[:space:]arg2
		 custom-test *
	Now when someone issues "site test moo", test.sh will be executed with
	3 arguments: test.sh arg1 arg2 moo.


 CONNECTION SETTINGS:
 --------------------
active_addr <IP|hostname> [#] [#] [IP|hostname]
	Tells glftpd which interface to bind to when doing active file
	transfers. Without this, glftpd uses the same interface the user
	connected to.

	If you have multiple active_addr lines, glftpd will cycle through them
	in a round-robin style each time the user transfers a file.

	The remaining arguments are used for loadbalancing.

	The second argument specifies the maximum download bandwith capacity
	allocated to this active_addr in KiB/s.
	The third argument does the same for upload.
	A 0 means that this is a fallback address that will only be
	used if the other active_addr's are fully loaded.
	The active_addr with the most remaining bandwidth will always be used
	in priority. If more than one active_addr is eligible, they will be
	cycled in a round-robin style.

	The fourth argument is used to specify which pasv_addr follows the same
	route as active_addr (needed for a precise computation of the speed,
	when passive mode is also used).

active_ports <X[-Y]> [X[-Y] ...]
	Causes glftpd to pick an open port between X and Y when making a
	active connection, instead of picking a random port.

	If Y isn't present, glftpd will just use X. If Y is present, glftpd
	will pick a random port between X and Y, including X and Y. If there are
	too many errors trying to pick a port from the current range, glftpd
	will move on to the next one.

	Maximum is 50 arguments. It makes most sense to use the biggest range
	as the first argument, since it'll be used more often.

	You should have at least 10 ports per user, so if you have 30 users
	online, this range should be 300, i.e. active_ports 13000-13300.

	This option together with pasv_ports will control which ports will be
	used on the server by glftpd.

bouncer_ip <IP|hostname> [IP|hostname ...]
	If you have (an) ftp bouncer(s), you have to put their IP('s) here so
	glftpd knows when the connection is from a bouncer and when it's from
	a regular user.

	Example: bouncer_ip 1.2.3.4 bnc.dynamicip.net static.bouncer.com

pasv_addr <IP|hostname> [1]
	Determines which IP or hostname is used for passive mode.

	If you want glftpd to bind to this interface (for example, if you use
	more than one NIC in the same box and you want passive connections to
	not use the default one), just do "pasv_addr x.x.x.x". If you want
	glftpd to only report this IP to the client but to bind to the default
	interface (as in when your box only has an internal IP and you're using
	NAT), do "pasv_addr x.x.x.x 1".

	If you have multiple pasv_addr lines, glftpd will cycle through them in
	a round-robin style each time a file is transferred using passive mode.
	When using both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, list an IPv4 after each IPv6 or
	vice versa and use an equal amount of each type to retain a semi
	round-robin style.

pasv_ports <X[-Y]> [X[-Y] ...]
	Causes glftpd to pick an open port between X and Y when making a
	passive connection, instead of picking a random port.

	If Y isn't present, glftpd will just use X. If Y is present, glftpd
	will pick a random port between X and Y, including X and Y. If there are
	too many errors trying to pick a port from the current range, glftpd
	will move on to the next one.

	Example: pasv_ports 10000-11000 20 21 22 23 80 110 1600-1610 35000-35050

	Maximum is 50 arguments. It makes most sense to use the biggest range
	as the first argument, since it'll be used more often.

	You should have at least 10 ports per user, so if you have 30 users
	online, this range should be 300, i.e. pasv_ports 2000-2300.

valid_ip <IP> [IP ...]
	If you have multiple IP's on your system, enter the ones you want glftpd
	to listen on. Only connections to the listed IP('s) will be allowed.

	Example: valid_ip 127.0.0.1
	This will only allow connections to localhost, and thus only connections
	from localhost will work.


 BANDWIDTH SETTINGS:
 -------------------
sim_xfers <#> [#]
	Global setting controlling the maximum allowed simultaneous downloads
	(first argument) and uploads (second argument) on the whole site.
	A -1 means unlimited and is the default.

	Note: Users with the EXEMPT flag are not affected and can download even
	if this limit is reached.

	Example: sim_xfers 10 -1
	This only allows 10 downloads at a time. If a user tries to download
	something and there are already 10 other downloads in progress, the
	user will receive an error message.

speed_limit <pathmask> <#> <#> [[!]permission ...]
	Global bandwidth limit based on directory and permissions.
	The second argument is the download limit, third argument the upload
	limit. Both are in bytes/second, 0 means unlimited.

	If you have multiple speed_limit rules, first path and permission match
	decides which rule is active.

	Example: speed_limit /site/Incoming* 150000 0
		 speed_limit /site/Archives* 50000 0 1
		 speed_limit /* 200000 0 =group -user
	This means that in all dirs matching "/site/Incoming*" (so also
	"/site/Incomingfiles/") the global downloadlimit is 150KB/s and no
	uploadlimit, in all dirs matching "/site/Archives*" the global
	downloadlimit is 50KB/s for siteops only and no uploadlimit, in all
	other dirs there's a global downloadlimit of 200KB/s for user "user"
	and users of group "group". All other users and for all other paths
	have no speedlimits besides their own.


 RIGHTS SETTINGS:
 ----------------
Function		Pathmask		Permission
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
delete			/site/GRP_PRE/*		=GRP
	Who can delete files owned by anyone where.

deleteown		/site*			!8 *
	Who can delete their own files where.

dirlog			/site/incoming/????/*/	*
	Who can add new directories to the dirlog (used for 'site search') and
	to glftpd.log if using the -l switch in the inetd daemon.

download		/site/*			!-viewer *
	Who can download files from where.

filemove		/site/incoming/*	=STAFF
	Who can move files (rename to other directories) from where.

hideinwho		/private/pre/directory*	!1 !=STAFF *
	For who are users hidden (via the "hideuser" setting) from 'site who'
	while in which paths.

makedir			/site*			*
	Who can create directories where.

rename			/site/GRP_PRE/*		=GRP 1 =STAFF
	Who can rename files owned by anyone where.

renameown		/site/*			=TRUSTED

unnuke			/site/incoming/????/*	*
	Who with access to the unnuke command can unnuke where.

upload			/site/incoming/????/*/*	*
	Who can upload files to where.

nostats			/site/requests/*	*
	Who should not get files uploaded/downloaded statistics change where.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	These are examples only and do not reflect the tree you need to use.
	See the file glftpd.conf-EXAMPLES for more examples.

	The functions are read from top to bottom. The first directory match
	will stop the search, so you should put the more specific directories on
	top and the least specific ones on the bottom.

	Special variables:
	If the paths in the settings contain "[:username:]" or "[:groupname:]",
	glftpd will replace them with the current user's username or primary
	groupname, respectively.

	Example: upload /home/[:username:]/* *
        This will only allow joe to upload in /home/joe.


 NUKE SETTINGS:
 --------------
empty_nuke <#>
	The amount of KiB that will be removed from the user if its "empty"
	directory is nuked. See the "nukedir_style" setting for when a directory
	is considered empty.

multiplier_max <#>
	The highest multiplier a nuker can use, default is "unlimited".

nukedir_style [string] [0|1|2|3] [#]
	Settings for the 'site nuke' command.

	The default is: nukedir_style %N 2 50000

	The first argument specifies what the nuked dir will be renamed to.
	Possible vars are:
	  %N = original dirname
	  %% = %

	The second argument specifies what should be done with the files and
	directory:
	  0 = delete all nuked directories
	  1 = delete files, keep directories
	  2 = keep files and directories
	  3 = Keep files, directories and "empty" dirs
	If you want to be able to unnuke, you must set this to 2 or 3.

	If the size in bytes of all files in the nuked directory is below the
	third argument, the directory will be treated as empty and nuked with
	the empty dir penalty, see the "empty_nuke" setting.

	Note: files matching the masks set at the "ignore_type" setting are not
	used to calculate the size of the directory.

nukesubdir_style <string>
	Specifies the style of the directory created within a nuked directory.
	The string set here is always prepended by "NUKED %dx " upon a nuke,
	with %d being the multiplier.
	The usable vars are:
	  %U = nuker's username
	  %M = the nuke reason
	  %% = %
	Default is "by[:space:]%U[:space:]-[:space:]%M".


 APPEARANCE SETTINGS:
 --------------------
banner <filepath>
	Displayed before the prompt for username.

color_mode <0|1>
	This option determines whether colors are present in directory listings
	when a user has the color flag.

	Use "color_mode 0" to prevent glftpd from using color codes in directory
	listings. The control connection (the dialog between client and server)
	will show colors when the user has the color flag turned on.

	Use "color_mode 1" to make glftpd act like before, using colors both in
	the control connection and directory listing. This is the default.

dir_names <0|1> ["lower"|"upper"|string] [XY ...]
	Which conversions to do on new and renamed directory names.

	The first argument makes the first symbol capitalized when enabled.

	The second argument converts the case of all other symbols. To disable
	use any word other than "lower" or "upper".

	The third and following arguments convert specified symbols X to the
	specified symbols Y. If the symbol Y is the word "NULL", the symbol X
	of that pair will simply be deleted.

	Example: dir_names 1 lower [:space:]_ ,. [( ])
	This will change the case of every character in new directories to lower
	case, capitalize the first character, convert all spaces to underscores,
	all commas to periods, and all brackets to parentheses.

	Example: dir_names 1 nothing ,NULL 'NULL
	This will delete commas and apostrophes.

email <string>
	Admin's e-mail (used for the e-mail cookie and the site help output).

file_dl_count <0|1>
	When enabled (the default), glftpd increments a file's GID by 1 when it
	is downloaded (up to 99 times). This number is displayed when you do a
	long listing (list -l) and your color is on (so it's safe to assume
	you're in UNIX; Windows clients choke on listings like that).

file_names <0|1> ["lower"|"upper"|string] [XY ...]
	Which conversions to do on new and renamed file names.

	See "dir_names" for an explanation of the arguments.

goodbye_msg <filepath> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Displayed at logoff.

	Same matching as "welcome_msg".

login_prompt <string>
	String to replace the standard login prompt.

lslong <string> [#]
	This sets the default 'ls' command parameters.
	All options should be combined as one string prepended with -,
	unrecognized options are silently ignored.
	Recognized options are:	1aAcCdefFGklLnorRsStuUX, see 'man ls' for
	more information on what they do.

	The second argument specifies the number of asterisks that are allowed
	in arguments to LIST, this to prevent abuse of the globbing function
	which could raise load average on the box to very high levels.
	The default is 2, use 0 for unlimited.

	Example: lslong -an
	This will show hidden files by default and only show UIDs and GIDs
	instead of the usernames and groupnames in long format.

	Example: lslong - 3
	No special options, list /*/*/* will work but list /*/*/*/* not.

max_gstats <#> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	The maximum amount of results shown when the matching users use the
	group stats commands, being the all, month, week and day up and download
	tops.

	The first argument specifies the maximum number of results shown for the
	users matching the permissions. Use -1 to have no limit. Default is 10.

	First match wins so order is important. Thus if you would like everyone
	with flag 1 to be able to see the complete top but others only the first
	10 then you would need:
	 max_gstats -1 1
	 max_gstats 10 *

max_ustats <#> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	The maximum amount of results shown when the matching users use the user
	stats commands, being the all, month, week and day up and download tops.

	The first argument specifies the maximum number of results shown for the
	users matching the permissions. Use -1 to have no limit. Default is 10.

	First match wins so order is important. Thus if you would like everyone
	with flag 1 to be able to see the complete top but others only the first
	10 then you would need:
	 max_ustats -1 1
	 max_ustats 10 *

msgpath <pathmask> <filepath> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Display a file (second argument) when a user matching the permissions
	enters a directory within a path matching the pathmask.

	Note: a trailing slash at the end of the pathmask is mandatory if no
	wildcard is present.

	Example: msgpath /site/inc/ /ftp-data/misc/incoming.txt *
	This shows incoming.txt only when entering "/site/inc/".

	Example: msgpath /site/inc/????/* /ftp-data/misc/dir_and_subdirs.txt *
	This shows the file when entering a directory matching "/site/inc/????/"
	and any of it's subdirs, subsubdirs etc.

	Example: msgpath /site/inc/????/*/ /ftp-data/misc/somedirs.txt *
	Same as above but only the subdirs of "/site/inc/????/".

newsfile <filepath> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Displayed after the first cwd-command you issue.

	Same matching as "welcome_msg", except the search will not stop and all
	matches will be displayed.

show_diz <filename> [[!]permission ...]
	A file that will be shown if it exists in the directory that you enter.
	You can have multiple lines and they can be bound to permissions.
	The filename is case-sensitive and no wildcards or the likes allowed.

	Cookies present in the file will not be interpreted by glftpd due to
	security concerns.

	Example: show_diz FILE_ID.DIZ 1
		 show_diz .message
	This would show the files FILE_ID.DIZ just for siteops and .message for
	everyone when you change into any directory in which they exist.

show_totals <#> <pathmask> [pathmask ...]
	When a user enters a directory matching a pathmask, the totals for this
	directory (race info) will be calculated and displayed, showing max
	results specified in the first argument.

	You can have multiple lines with multiple (max 49) path arguments each.

	Example: show_totals 30 /site/incoming/????/*/
	This will show statistics for all directories in /incoming/0301, but
	not for their subdirectories (remove the trailing / if you want that).

sitename_long <string>
	Your site's name.

sitename_short <string>
	The abbreviation of your site's name.

timezone <+|-><#>
	This modifies the timezone + or - for different regions.

	Example: timezone -4
	This will show the time 4 hours behind what it was showing originally.

	Note: this setting has been reported to slow down glftpd for some
	people for unknown reasons, it works fine for most. Because of this,
	there is still an unfixed bug: new files and directories will have the
	system time, not the timezone-corrected time.

	It's best to use the 'localtime fix' instead of this setting - search
	the FAQ for how to do that.

use_dir_size <"b"|"g"|"k"|"m"> <path> [path ...]
	This will make glftpd show directories' size (the total size of all
	files in that directory), instead of the number of bytes the directory
	itself takes up, when a user does a "LIST".

	The size can be shown in b = bytes, k = KiB, m = MiB or g = GiB.

	Note: For slow processors/harddrives, this might cause slow dir listing.

	The second argument should be the path for which this option will work.
	You may specify several paths. No wildcards. You don't even need full
	paths, instead of /site you can use /si and it will work for /site as
	well as every other directory starting with /si, and every subdirectory
	of that directory.

	Example: use_dir_size k /
	This will show directory size, in kilobytes, for every directory on
	your site.

	Example: use_dir_size m /site/incom /site/priva
	This will show directory size, in megabytes, for every directory that
	begins with "/site/incom" and "/site/priva", like /site/incoming,
	/site/incoming/whatever, /site/private, /site/privateer, etc.

welcome_msg <filepath> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	A file displayed at login, after the user has entered its password.

	If you have multiple lines, glftpd will try to match the user with the
	permissions on the right. The first match will display the file (first
	argument) and stop the search.


 TRANSFER SETTINGS:
 ------------------
allow_fxp <"yes"|"no"> <"yes"|"no"> <"yes"|"no"> [[!]permission ...]
	Fxp is an unofficial name for site-to-site transfers, where a user can
	directly upload from, or download to, another ftp server. This is done
	by "cheating" the ftp server, and using another server's IP and port in
	the PORT command.
	This setting can check whether the IP in the PORT command is the same as
	the IP the user connected from. If it isn't, then the user is trying to
	establish a connection to another ftp server and this will be denied if
	the user doesn't match permissions. This will also check whether an
	incoming data connection, when using the PASV command, is from the user
	or not (this is another way to cheat).

	The first argument controls if fxp downloads are allowed, the second if
	uploads are allowed. The third argument, if set to yes, will log all
	attempted transfers (whether successful or not) to foreign addresses to
	transfer.log for users that match permissions.

	Defaults are: allow_fxp yes yes no *

	If you have multiple allow_fxp rules, first permission match decides
	which rule is active.

	Example: allow_fxp no yes no =Leech 8
	This will allow people in group Leech or anonymous users to upload from
	foreign addresses (like other ftp sites), but will not allow them to
	download to foreign addresses. All other users are allowed both.

	Example: allow_fxp yes yes yes *
	This will allow everyone to do site-to-site transfers, but it will log
	all of them to transfer.log.

	Example: allow_fxp yes yes no =STAFF
		 allow_fxp no yes no *
	This will allow users in group STAFF to both download and upload using
	fxp, and it will deny downloads for everyone else.

pre_fxp_check <filepath> [pathmask]
        Can additionally control allow_fxp by a script

        Parameters are:
        # $1 = Direction of FXP "from" or "to"
        # $2 = IP
        # $3 = Name of the file
        # $4 = Actual path the file is stored in
 
        See "pre_check" for pathmask info, echoing and exitcodes.

ascii_downloads <#> [filemask ...]
	The maximum byte size that can be downloaded in ASCII mode.
	Set it to 0 or any string (like 'disabled') to disable size check.

	The filemasks specify which files are allowed in ASCII mode. Files that
	don't match them have to be downloaded in BINARY mode. Omitting this
	setting is the same as using *, meaning all files will be downloadable.

	Example: ascii_downloads 20000 *.[Tt][Xx][Tt] *.[Dd][Ii][Zz]
	This will only allow downloading of .txt and .diz files that are 20
	thousand bytes or smaller in ASCII mode.

	Note: directory listings are not affected by this.

calc_crc <filemask|pathmask> [filemask|pathmask ...]
	This is for on-the-fly CRC checking. It can take multiple arguments.
	You can use filemasks or paths or you can mix them.

	The CRC will be passed on to the post_check script as third argument.
	If you upload a file that does not match any mask listed and is not in
	any path listed, "00000000" will be used.

	Example: calc_crc *.rar /site/rars/games/* *.[Mm][Pp][3]
	This will calculate CRC for all rars, all files uploaded to the
	/site/rars/games directory (and its subdirectories), and all mp3s,
	including different cases (like .MP3 or .Mp3).

creditcheck <pathmask> <#> [[!]permission ...]
	Set different ratio than default when in paths matching pathmask.

	If the user doesn't match the permissions on the right, glftpd will
	move on to the next rule. Pathmask is only checked if the permissions
	for the rule apply. If you don't have any permissions, * is assumed, so
	the rule applies to everyone.

	This ratio is only used for uploading, users get file size * ratio
	credits when they upload. This isn't used for downloading, so setting
	this to 0 doesn't allow users to download for free. Use the "creditloss"
	setting for that.

creditloss <#> <"yes"|"no"> <filepathmask> [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Sets the multiplier for credits lost in paths matching pathmask.
	This is sort of a reverse-ratio.

	If the first argument is 0, users downloading files in paths matching
	pathmask will not lose any credits. If it's >1, users that match this
	rule will lose that number * filesize of credits for each file they
	download matching pathmask.

	If the second argument is "no" and the user's active ratio (either main
	ratio if sratio for the current section is -1, or sratio) is 0, the
	user will be denied downloads from paths matching pathmask. The error
	given is the same as if the user had no 'download' right in glftpd.conf.

	You can have multiple creditloss statements - first path match wins.

	Example: creditloss 0 yes /site/freestuff/* *
	This will allow everyone to download for free from /site/freestuff/

	Example: creditloss 2 yes /site/heavystuff/* =somegroup
	This will charge members of somegroup twice the amount of credits
	they would lose for downloading files from /site/heavystuff without
	this rule.

	Example: creditloss 3 no /site/specialfile.zip *
	This will cause file /site/specialfile.zip to cost 3 * file size of
	credits to users downloading it, and users with leech (ratio=0) will
	not be allowed to download it at all.

dl_incomplete <0|1>
	Allow or deny users to download a file before it is completely uploaded.

	It is recommended to set this to 1 (the default); if a file is in the
	process of being uploaded and a user tries to download it, then the
	transfer will not be closed until the file is finished. That way no
	incomplete files will be downloaded when the upload goes slower than
	the download.
	When this setting is enabled, files being upload have 0755 permissions,
	otherwise 0600.

	Note: this only works if the upload is steady; if there are long periods
	of inactivity during the upload (over 30 seconds), glftpd stops waiting
	and closes the transfer. It does this by checking the file's
	modification time, so older files with 755 permissions will be sent
	without waiting.

freefile <filemask>  [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Files matching the filemask can be downloaded for free by those matching
	the permissions. As soon as a filemask matches, the search stops.


 MEMORY SETTINGS:
 ----------------
dl_sendfile <#>
	This option determines if we should use the zerocopy systemcall
	sendfile() on systems where this is available. This option overrules
	mmap_amount which is one of the 3 possible downloading methods:
	plain, mmap and zerocopy.
	The number specifies the blocksize (in KiB) for one sendfile systemcall.
	During the call the shmem (user info) is not updated, so for slow lines
	it's better to use a low number.

	Setting this to 0 or smaller disables the option, the default is 512.
	This option is also disabled if the user has a speedlimit or the
	transfer is using TLS. In all other cases this function is recommended.

	Note: This system is not available on all operating systems, confirmed
	to support this are Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX.

free_space <#>
	This will prevent people from uploading if your free space on current
	drive is smaller than the given size in MB. The default size is 10 MB.
	Without this, if there is for example only 1 MB of free space and
	someone is uploading files of 3 MB, all of them would fail the test and
	be deleted, resulting in a big waste of bandwidth.

ipc_key <string>
	Glftpd uses shared memory, so it needs to use an ipc_key. The default
	key that glftpd uses is "0x0000DEAD". A second key being ipc_key+2 or
	"0x0000DEAF" is	used for a seperate shared memory segment holding extra
	transfer data.

	When running another glftpd server, a different ipc_key needs to be
	defined in its own config file. The key can be any 8-digit hexadecimal
	string, like: 0x01234567, 0xDEADBABE, 0xBEEFBABE, 0xBADC0FEE, etc but
	should not be ipc_key+1 (see "ipc_key_dirlog" setting) or ipc_key+2.

	If you're using external tools which use shmem, you should verify the
	correct ipc key is used to gather data.

ipc_key_dirlog <string>
	Part of the dirlog is also stored in shared memory, which uses another
	ipc_key. The default key is glftpd's ipc_key+1 or "0x0000DEAE".

	See the "ipc_key" setting for which strings can be used.

mmap_amount <#>
	The size can be from 0 to 100 and represents the size in MiB.
	Files being downloaded and smaller than the given size are kept in
	memory, causing a faster download for users wanting the same file.
	Setting this to 0 or smaller disables the option, the default is 5.

	If you have little memory and big files, setting this to a low number
	may also improve speed.

ul_buffered_force <#>
	The size can be from 0 to 100 and represents the size in MiB.
	Data being uploaded is stored in a buffer equal to the given size,
	which should decrease disk writes.
	Setting this to 0 or smaller disables the option, which is the default.

	WARNING: this feature should only be used on special file systems which
	for some weird reason need it; it won't make your uploads faster as
	buffering done by the operating system is always faster and doesn't
	create such a system load.


 OTHER SETTINGS:
 ---------------
alias <string> <path>
	Defines an alias for a directory.

	Example: alias util /incoming/utils
	This would allow a user to issue the command 'cwd util' anywhere, and it
	would take the user to "$HOME/incoming/utils", with $HOME the user's
	home directory like /site (in which case it'd be /site/incoming/utils).

cdpath <path>
	Defines a search-path when changing directories.

	Example: cdpath /incoming/utils
		 cdpath /incoming/games
	If a user tries to cwd to the directory "foo", it will be searched for
	in the following order:

	./foo
	an alias called 'foo'
	$HOME/incoming/utils/foo
	$HOME/incoming/games/foo

	where $HOME is the user's home directory (/site by default).

	This only works with the cwd and xcwd commands.

dupe_check <#> ["yes"|"no"]
	Sets the amount of days back to check for dupe filenames.
	Set this to 0 to disable dupe-checking, which is the default.

	The second parameter is optional - "no" is assumed if it's missing.
	It refers to ignoring file case when checking dupes. If you set it to
	"yes", it will act like Windows, so file.zip will be treated the same as
	FILE.zip and glftpd will say it's a dupe.

	The datapath/logs/dupefile is automatically "compressed" after every
	1000th added file in average by removing all entries older than your
	days limit.

idle_commands <stringlist>
	This sets which commands to ignore when resetting the idle counter.

	The 'STOR', 'APPE' and 'RETR' commands can't be used as idle commands
        because the timer *has to* be refreshed during transfer, otherwise
        people would drop out downloading big files.

	Example: idle_commands noop pwd cwd* site[:space:]who
	This will not reset the idle counter when a user issues noop, pwd, cwd
	(alone or followed by other characters/arguments), or "site who", so
	users who use these commands and not any others will be disconnected
	after their idle timeout expires.

	Note: the "idle time" that you see in site who, gl_spy, etc, is NOT
        the same timer used to disconnect people, it is time idle since the
        last command issued by the user. The "real" idle timer is internal and
        cannot be seen (not that there is any reason to see it).

ignore_type <filemask> [filemask ...]
	Will ignore the files matching the given filemasks in the directory race
	info ("show_totals" option), nukes, unnukes and dupes.
	You can have multiple lines with max 50 arguments per line.

	Example: ignore_type *.[tT][xX][tT] *.[nN][fF][oO] [rR][eE][aA][dD][mM][eE] .message
		 ignore_type *.[sS][fF][vV] *.[cC][rR][cC] *.[dD][iI][zZ]

lastonline <0|1|2> [#]
	This setting determines when users are logged upon logout.
	If 0, all users will be logged.
	If 1, users who timed out and didn't upload, download, nuke or add users
	will not be logged.
	If 2, users who quit, timed out or lost connection and didn't upload,
	download, nuke, or add users will not be logged.

	The second argument is the default number of lines to show when someone
	does 'site laston'. If none specified the default is 10.

	If there is no lastonline line in the config we will not log at all.

master <user> [<user> ...]
	Here you can specify the master(s) of the site. The master(s) can change
	anyone's flags and deluser anyone, including all siteops.

max_users <#> [#]
	The maximum number of users allowed to log in at once.

	The first argument specifies the maximum amount of users allowed to
	connect to the site, default 1.
	The second specifies how many extra users with the exempt-flag can
	connect, if the site is already full. Default 0. If the site isn't full,
	then exempt users take up a slot, just like everyone else. So if you
	have max_users 5 5, and 5 exempt users are logged in, then noone else
	will be able to log in.

	Note: You cannot change this setting with people connected to the site;
	you MUST have 0 users connected and no gl_spy running, otherwise you'll
	get a "220 Server Error: (SHMGET) Failed!" error. See the FAQ for a fix.

nodupecheck <pathmask>
	This suspends both the internal dupe check (done by searching
	datapath/logs/dupefile) and the execution of pre_check scripts (also
	called dupescript) for files uploaded in a path matching pathmask.
	Multiple lines allowed.

nopathmatch <pathmask>
	This disables pathmatching in paths matching pathmask when trying to
	CWD into a dir that doesn't exist. Example: if you are in a dir with a
	subdir "incoming" and you try to "CWD incom" then, if "incom" does not
	exist, is not an alias and also not a dir in a defined cdpath, it will
	match "incoming" and enter it. Multiple lines allowed.

nosymderef <pathmask>
	This causes symlinks not to be dereferenced when cwding to paths
	matching the pathmask. The main effect is that you can cwd back to the
	directory containing the symlink, previously having cwd'd to, by cwd'ing
	to the parent (either via 'cdup', 'xcup', 'cwd ..' or 'xcwd ..').

oneliners <#>
	This tells the number of oneliners to show on the site onel command.
	Set to 0 to disable oneliners, which is the default.

requests <filepath> <#>
	Where is the request display file and how many requests to store.
	You can use 0 as second argument to disable requesting.

	Example: requests /ftp-data/misc/requests 10

shutdown [!]<permission> [[!]permission ...]
	Shuts glftpd down for everyone EXCEPT the users matching on the right.

	'shutdown 0' is the same as 'shutdown *'
	Glftpd will display the /ftp-data/text/shutdown file to users that
	are denied login because of this setting.

	Example: shutdown 1 =STAFF
	This will only allow users with flag 1 and members of group STAFF to
	log in.

	Example: shutdown !*
	This will not allow anyone to log in.

stat_section <string> <pathmask> ["yes"|"no"]
	Here you can define up to 10 multiple statistic sections, including the
	default section which should always be added as the first stat section:
		stat_section DEFAULT * yes

	The last argument specifies if credits are to be counted seperately. If
	not provided this defaults to "no" meaning they are counted in the
	DEFAULT stat_section.

	If you want to create one section from multiple paths, use the special
	keyword "[:and:]" to separate the paths, like:
		stat_section LINUX /slackware[:and:]/debian[:and:]/redhat yes

	Based on the directory you are in, the 'site USERS', 'site GIVE',
	'site TAKE', 'site GINFO' and all stats commands show or change data
	from the current stat section only.

	All stat commands that display text files with cookies in them look for
	STRINGfilename when invoked in a stat section other than DEFAULT.

	Example: stat_section GAMES /site/incoming/games/* yes
		 stat_section UTILS /site/incoming/utils/* no
	This would make 2 new sections, 1 Games and 1 Utils. The games section
	is using a seperate credit system which means that all uploads,
	downloads and credits will change as soon as a user changes to the games
	directory. If the user goes into the utils directory then only the
	uploads and downloads will change but the credits will be the same as in
	the default section.

tagline <string>
	If a user's tagline matches string, he will be forced to change it
	before glftpd lets the user download.

total_users <#>
	This sets a limit of how many users that can be added.

xdupe <filemask> [filemask ...]
	If the user turns x-dupe on, only files which match any of the filemasks
	will be reported.
	Default is "*.zip *.[Rr][0-9][0-9] *.[Rr][Aa][Rr] *.[Mm][Pp]3".

	Example: xdupe *.zip *.r?? *.gz *.tgz
	This will report zips, rars, gzips and gzipped tars on the x-dupe line.


,-----------------------------.
| B. Site command permissions |
`-----------------------------'

    Below is a list of configurable site commands (or grouping of). To the right
    of a command are the permissions (same format as settings) to be able to
    execute the command.

    By default, gadmins have access to the following commands:
     -addip, -adduser, -changeratio, -chpass, -delip, -deluser, -flags, -ginfo,
     -grpnfo, -readd, -userextra, -grp.
    These commands are gadmin-restricted, meaning that if you are a gadmin you
    can only use those commands on users who are in the same group as your first
    (primary) group. Other commands are not gadmin-restricted, so if you give
    gadmins access to them, they will be able to use them on ANY user.
    The -purge and -usercomment commands are also gadmin-restricted, but gadmins
    don't have access to them by default.

    You can define your own "You do not have access to this command." message
    for each of the commands.
    First, create directory "ad" in "/rootpath/datapath/misc". Then, create a
    file in that directory with the same name as the command keyword in the list
    below without the leading dash, and put the text you want displayed in it.
    For custom site commands use "custom-yourcommand".
    Glftpd will try to display the individual file first; if that doesn't work,
    it will show the generic no access error.
    Example: if you want "You do not have access to see who is online" to be
    displayed when a user does "site who" without access to it, create a file
    "/rootpath/datapath/misc/ad/who" with that text in it.

   The same argument naming conventions are used here as for glftpd.conf.

 USERMANAGEMENT COMMANDS:
 ------------------------
site adduser <string> <string> [string@<IPmask|hostmask> ...]
	Adds a user with first argument as username and second as password.

	See "site renuser" for info and restrictions for the username.

	See "site chpass" for info and restrictions for the password.

	The optional arguments can be max 5 and are ident@IP's for the user.

	If a user is added by a groupadmin, that user will have the GLOCK flag
	enabled and will inherit default values from the "default."<groupname>
	file if existing, or "default.user" otherwise. The latter will also be
	used for users not being added by a groupadmin.
	
	Example: site adduser Archimede mypassword
	This would add the user "Archimede" with the password "mypassword".

	Example: site adduser Archimede mypassword *@127.0.0.1
	This would do the same as above and add the ip '*@127.0.0.1' at the
	same time.

site addip <user> <string@<IPmask|hostmask|IP/#>> [string@<IPmask|hostmask|IP/#> ...]
	Add an ident@IP to the user. Max 10 at a time.

	Example: site addip Archimede Archimede@127.0.0.1 *@10.10. no@*.isp.net
	This would add the ident@IP "Archimede@127.0.0.1", ipmask "*@10.10.*"
	and hostmask "no@*.isp.net" to user "Archimede". The * at the end is
	optional and auto-added.

	Example: site addip lamer someident@3.1.2.1[2-5]?
	This will add the mask matching IP's 3.1.2.120 through 3.1.2.159.
	Warning: you can't use [] to declare a range of numbers > 9, so [20-59]
	will not work. Use [2-5]? or [2-5][0-9] instead. Ranges that don't start
	at a power of 10 or don't end at 9 are not possible unless you add
	more than 1 mask.

	Example: site addip barmy *@6.0.0.0/8
	This adds the IP in CIDR notation 6.0.0.0/8. The zeroes can be any
	number, they are silently ignored.
	When adding such IP's, all fields must be fully numeric, have 1 slash
	and a bitindicator between 0 and 32 or 128 including.

site change <user> <string> <string>
site change <=group> <string> <string>
site change <{> <user> [user ...] <}> <string> <string>
site change <*> <string> <string>
	Changes a setting for a user or users.
	The second argument in any of these commands is a user's setting.
	The argument following it will be the new value, if accepted.

	The first command changes the value for one user, the second for all
	users in the group, the third for all users in the list (max 30) and the
	fourth command is for all users.

	Available settings:

				Only one section at a time is supported.
				Changing this immediately replaces the amount if

	homedir		[path]	Changes the user's homedir.
				This command is disabled by default, see the
				"min_homedir" setting in glftpd.conf to enable.
				Important: don't use a trailing '/' in the path!
				Users CANNOT cd, list, upload/download, etc,
				outside of their homedir. It acts similarly to
				chroot() (try man chroot).
				When no value is given, the current homedir is
				shown.
	startup_dir	<path>	The directory to start in when logging in.
				This is /rootpath/homedir/path.
				Example: if path is "/incoming", rootpath is

				Users CAN cd, list, upload/download, etc,
				outside of startup_dir.
	idle_time	<#>	Sets the default and maximum idle time for this
				user (overrides the -t and -T settings on glftpd
				command line). If -1, it is disabled; if 0, it
				is the same as the idler flag.
	expires		<string> The date a user expires, after this date a user
				will no longer be able to login. Format used is
				"yyyy-mm-dd", use "never" or "0" to disable.
	credits		<#>	Replace credits in KiB left to download.
	flags		<-|+><flag>[[-|+flag][flag ...] ...]
				Type 'site flags' for a list of flags.

				number is number of simultaneous logins from the
				same IP. 0 = Unlimited, max is 30000.
	timeframe	<#> [#]	The hour from which to allow logins and the hour
				when logins from this user will be rejected.
				This is set in 24 hour format, min 0 and max 23.
				If a user is online past its timeframe, the user
				will be disconnected at the next 'CWD'.
	time_limit	<#>	Time limits, per LOGIN SESSION, in minutes.
				0 = Unlimited.
	tagline		<stringlist> User's tagline (max 63 symbols).
	comment		<stringlist> Changes the user's comment (max 49 symbols).
	max_dlspeed	<#>	Downstream bandwidth control in KiB/s.
				0 = Unlimited.
	max_ulspeed	<#>	Same but for upstream.

				serverreplies. Can also be changed via the
				'site color' command.

				Use 'site deluser' to give or 'site readd' to
				take this flag.
	USEREDIT	7	"Co-Siteop"
	ANONYMOUS	8	Anonymous user (per-session like login).
				No DELE, RMD or RNTO/RNFR; '!' on login is

	CUSTOM1		J	Custom flag 1
	CUSTOM2		K	Custom flag 2
	CUSTOM3		L	Custom flag 3
	CUSTOM4		M	Custom flag 4
	CUSTOM5		N	Custom flag 5

	Custom flags can be used in the config file to give some users access to
	certain things without having to use private groups. These flags will
	only show up in 'site flags' if they're turned on. Custom flags up to
	'Z' can be used.

	Note: flag 1 is not GOD mode, you must have the correct flags for the
	actions you wish to perform.
	Note: a user with flag 1 DOES NOT WANT flag 2.
	Note: flags A-H can have their access changed through the -flag
	permissions in the config file.

	Example: site change Archimede ratio 5
	This would set the ratio to 1:5 for the user "Archimede".

site chgadmin <user> <group>
	Toggle the users gadmin status for the given group.

	When a user becomes a gadmin he will automatically get flag 2 added.

	flag will be automatically removed.

site chgrp <user> [group ...]
	Adds and/or removes a user from (a) group(s), max 20 at a time (10 to

	otherwise "archimede" is removed from "ftp".

site chpass <user> <string> 
	Change user's password to the second argument.

	See the "secure_pass" setting if a password can't be changed with error
	"Password is not secure enough".

	or '@'. The first means any password will let the user log in, the
	second that the password has to be an email address.

site chpgrp <user> <group>
	Sets the primary group for a user. If the user is not yet a member, the
	user is added to the group and the group is set as primary group. When
	adding a user to a group, the group must have available slots left, even
	when being a siteop.

	Example: site chpgrp archimede ftp
	This would change the primary group to 'ftp' for the user 'archimede',
	adding the user to it if not yet a member and with slots available.

site delip <user> <#|string@<IPmask|hostmask|IP/#>> [#|string@<IPmask|hostmask|IP/#> ...]
	Delete an IP from user by giving the exact "string@IPmask" or
	"string@hostmask" as added to the user, or use the ranknumber (see
	'site user "user"'). Max. 10 arguments, excluding the user-argument.

	Example: site delip Archimede Archimede@127.0.0.1
	This removes the ident@ip 'Archimede@127.0.0.1' from user "Archimede".

	Example: site delip Archimede 1
	This removes ident@ip #1 from user "Archimede".

site deluser <user>
	Delete a user, may be readded with 'site readd'.
	In order to delete a user permanently, 'site purge' must be used.

	Example: site deluser Archimede
	This will activate the DELETED (6) flag for user "Archimede".

site gadduser <group> <string> <string> [string@<IPmask|hostmask|IP/#> ...]
	Adds a user and adds it to the given group at the same time. If a
	"datapath/users/default.group" file exists, it will be used as a base
	instead of "default.user".

        Only public groups can be used as group. When adding a user to a group,
	the group must have available slots left, even when being a siteop.

	See "site adduser" for more info on syntax.

site purge [user]
	Removes deleted users permanently, readding with 'site readd' will NOT
	work for purged users.

	If no argument is given, then all the deleted users will be removed.

site readd [user]
	Shows a list of deleted users who can be readded (same as
	'site users deleted') or readds the given user (have flag 6 removed).

	Note: when readding a user, all groups the user was member of need to
	have available slots, even when being a siteop.

	ex. site readd Archimede
	This will remove the DELETED flag for user "Archimede".
	
site renuser <user> <string>
	Rename a user to the second argument.

	Username can be max 23 symbols and may not contain '/' or ':', not start
	with "default." or end with ".lock" or ".[1-9][0-9]*".

	Lists users and shows their primary group, UL/DL stats and credits.
	Without an argument, all users except deleted are listed.
	Deleted users are never shown except when using "deleted" as argument.

	When the argument is a group, only members of that group are listed.
	When it is a flag, only users with that flag are listed.

	When the argument ends with a '*' (and does not start with a "="), the
	symbols before it are interpreted as the first part of a username. All
	users with a username starting with those symbols will then be listed.

	If the argument is "help", usage info is shown.

	Other possible arguments, apart from flag, group and partial username:
	"*", "all", "anonymous", "deleted", "exempt", "gadmin", "give", "glock",

 STATISTIC COMMANDS:
 -------------------
site aldn [#] [#|string] [=group]
	Display alltime downloaders. All arguments can be left out or used in
	almost any combination or order.

	First argument controls the number of users shown.
	Second argument is a section name or number (0-9). If section is a
	number, it needs to be preceeded by the number of users shown.

	This is the same for all statistic commands (wkup, gpal, nuketop, etc).

	Specifying a group will only show users who belong to that group, but
	the user doing it has to have special access in glftpd.conf to do it.
	This is controlled by the -grpstats permission.

	This is the same for all user statistic commands (wkup, nuketop, etc).

	Example: site aldn =Friends
	Shows top 10 of alltime downloaders in group "Friends".

	Example: site aldn 20 LinuxSection =Leechers
	Shows top 20 of alltime downloaders in group "Leechers" for the

 DATABASE COMMANDS:
 ------------------
site dupe [-"max" <#>] [-"from" <string>] [-"to" <string>] <stringlist>
	Searches the dupe database ("rootpath/datapath/logs/dupelog") for
	directories that have been created on site matching ALL search strings.
	Searching a big database can take quite some time so please be patient
	and try not to use common words. Do NOT include wildcards!
	Searchstrings are case insensitive.
	
	If -max is not specified, glftpd defaults to 20 matches. Matches are
	taken from the bottom of the dupelog (newest entries are at the bottom).

	The format for the "-from" and "-to" options is "MMDDYY".

	Example: site dupe quake
	This will search the database for the string "quake".

	Example: site dupe quake arena
	This will find "Quake_Arena" but not just "Quake".

	Example: site dupe -from 010199 -to 010100 duke nukem 3D
	This will search for "duke", "nukem", and "3D" in all of 1999.

	Example: site dupe -max 50 linux glftpd 1.
	This will show up to 50 entries with "glftpd", "linux" and "1." in the
	name, like "Glftpd.for.linux.v1.20" or "glftpd.v1.19_for_linux".

site fdupe [#] <string>
	Searches the dupe database ("rootpath/datapath/logs/dupefile") for files
	that have been created on site matching the search string.
	Searching a big database can take quite some time so please be patient
	and try not to use common words. Do NOT include wildcards!
	Searchstring is case insensitive.

	The first argument limits the results, default 20 matches. Matches begin
	at the bottom of the dupefile (newest entries are at the bottom).
	A limit must be used if the searchstring is an integer as well.

	Example: site fdupe sample
	This will search the database for the string "sample".

	Example: site fdupe 10 vivaldi
	This will show only the 10 newest files with vivaldi in them.

site predupe [stringlist/]<file>
	Adds the given file to to the file dupe database located at
	"rootpath/datapath/logs/dupefile" (rest is ignored).

	Only files not matching any filemasks at "ignore_type" settings in
	config file are added.

	The file dupe database is automatically "compressed" after every 1000th
	added file in average by removing all entries older than your days limit.

site search <stringlist>
	Searches the directory database ("rootpath/datapath/logs/dirlog") for
	directories on site matching ALL search strings.
	Searchstrings are case insensitive.

	If this command finds old non-existing directories, you need to run the
	"olddirclean2" utility to clean your dirlog. Best run it from crontab.

	Example: site search quake
	This searches the database for directories containing "quake".

	Example: site search linux gnu
	This will find all directories that contain both "linux" and "gnu".

site undupe [stringlist/]<filemask>
	Removes all files matching the filemask from the file dupe database
	located at "rootpath/datapath/logs/dupefile" (rest is ignored).

	Removal is only done for files not older than the "dupe_check" setting's
	first argument and not matching any filemasks at "ignore_type" settings
	in config file.

	Example: site undupe cls*
	This removes all files starting with "cls" from the file dupe database.

site update <dirmask>
	Adds all directories matching the given argument in the current working
	directory to the dirlog database.

	Note: this does not work recursively and skips directories without
	permissions higher than 0700.

	Example: site update A*
	This adds all directories beginning with "A" in the current working
	directory to the dirlog database.


 LOG COMMANDS:
 -------------
site errlog [#] [string]
	Display the error log ("rootpath/datapath/logs/error.log").

site laston [#] [-user] [=group] ["A"|"D"|"L"|"N"|"T"|"U"]
	Displays certain infos about the last users that were online (from
	"rootpath/datapath/logs/laston.log").
	Only works when the "lastonline" setting is enabled in config file.

	First argument is number of entries, second only shows entries from the
	given user, third only from users with the given group as primary group
	and the third argument filters entries for type.
	All arguments can be combined as chosen, only one of each at a time.
	By default 10 entries are shown without any filters.

	The types can be: A (Added user), D (Download), L (Lost connection), 
			  N (Nuked a dir), T (Timed out), U (Upload).

site logins [#] [string]
	Display the login log ("rootpath/datapath/logs/login.log").
	See "site syslog" info for syntax.

site new ["."] [#]
	Shows newest created directories (from "rootpath/datapath/logs/dirlog").

	in the current directory tree are shown.
	The last argument limits the amount of directories shown, default 10.

	Note: users only see directories created under their home directory.
	For a homedir being /site/public, no directories created in
	/site/private are shown by using site new.
	To achieve this, put a %NEW cookie in a text file with "/site/private"
	as a parameter  and use msgpath or a custom command to display it.

	Example: site new . 20
	This will show the last 20 dirs made in the current dir tree.

	Without any arguments, the whole log is shown. Use the first argument to
	only show those lines that are at max that many days old.

	If anything else than a number is used, only those lines containing the
	string are shown; this also matches the date and timestamps.
	Use two arguments if the string is a number. If the first argument is 0,
	all entries are shown.

	Example: site syslog 5
	This shows all entries from 5 days ago to now.

	Example: site syslog 10 deleted
	This show all entries with "deleted" in from 10 days ago to now.

	Example: site syslog 0 1999
	This shows all entries with "1999" in from the start of the log to now.

site unnukes [#]
	Show recently unnuked releases (from "rootpath/datapath/logs/nukelog").

	Argument limits amount of shown releases, default 10.


 SITE-INFORMATION COMMANDS:
 ---------------------
site alias [string]
	Show current aliases. If an argument is provided, it will give the path
	where the argument is an alias for if it's an existing alias.

site cdpath
	Show current cdpaths.

site help [string]
	Display helpscreen.
	If a sitecommand is given as argument, it's syntax is shown.

site stat
	Display your current status line, definable in
	"rootpath/datapath/text/statline.txt".

site time
	Display current time on the site.

site vers
	Show current glFTPd version.

site welcome
	Display the welcome screen.
	See the "welcome_msg" setting in config file.


 USERSETTINGS COMMANDS:
 ----------------------
site color ["on"|"off"|"show"]
	Enables, disables or shows the current mode for having colors in
	listings and other serverreplies. Depends however on the "color_mode"
	setting in config.

	If no arguments are specified, this will toggle colormode.

	Note: this will screw up many Windows FTP clients if enabled.

site flags [user]
	Display the logged in or given user's flags, definable in
	"rootpath/datapath/text/flags.txt".

	Example: site flags
	This will show the logged in user's flags.

	Example: site flags Archimede
	This will show flags of user "Archimede".

site group [group]
	Shows the logged in user's current public groups or joins/parts a group.
	All groups must be parted before a new one can be joined, no slots must
	be available in the group.
	Only via 'site chgrp' can private groups be joined/parted.

	Example: site group
	This will display the groups the logged in user is in.

	Example: site group ftp
	With this the logged in user joins or parts "ftp".

site idle [#]
	Sets the idle time limit in seconds for this session only. If no
	argument is provided, the current idle time limit is shown and the max
	that can be set. Default idle time is 900 and default max is 7200.
	See 'site change user idle_time', the IDLER (I) flag and the "-t" and
	"-T" flags for the daemon for altering the defaults.

site passwd <string>
	Change password for the logged in user.
	See "site chpass" for info and restrictions.

site tagline [stringlist]
	Shows the logged in user's tagline or sets it to the given argument.
	Only printable symbols and no '!', '"' and '%' allowed.

site xdupe [#]
	Shows the current xdupe mode or sets it to the given argument.
	See "xdupe" setting in config file.

	Possible values are:
	  0 = disabled, the default.
	  1 = several filenames per line divied by a space, up to 66 symbols;
	      filenames longer than 66 symbols are truncated.
	  2 = one filename per line; filenames londer than 66 are truncated.
	  3 = one filename per line; filenames are not truncated.

	Xdupe will allow clients that keep queues of files to be uploaded to
	quickly remove files from their queue if they already exist in the
	upload directory, without the need to refresh. This should minimize the
	number of "dupe"' errors as clients try to upload files that have
	already been uploaded by someone else to the current directory. When
	this is turned on, glFTPd will give a list of files, preceded by the
	string "X-DUPE: ", right before the usual "this file is a dupe" message.
	The files are first matched against a list of file masks on the "xdupe"
	line in glftpd.conf. See the included x-dupe-info.txt for more details.
	Known client to support this is pftp.


 FILE & DIRECTORY COMMANDS:
 ------------------------
site chmod <#> <path|filepath>
	Changes a directory's or file's permissions to the first argument. This
	should be a number in octal form ranging from 000 to 777.

	Example: site chmod 444 file.zip
	This makes "file.zip" in the current directory read-only.

	Example: site chmod 777 /site/incoming
	This makes the "/site/incoming" directory read and writeable by anyone.

site nuke <path|dir> <#> <stringlist>
	Nukes the first argument being a directory, either absolute or relative.
	If the directory contains spaces, use '{' and '}' around it.

	The second argument is the multiplier, which removes an extra amount of
	credits from the nukees. Total amount of credits removed follows this
	scheme: (ratio + multiplier - 1) x uploaded bytes. If the multiplier or
	ratio is 0, then no credits are removed at all.
	Also see the "multiplier_max" setting in the config file.

	The third argument is the reason for the nuke.

	Example: site nuke shit 2 CRAP
	This will nuke the directory "shit" with multiplier 2 and reason "CRAP".

	Example: site nuke {/incoming/A dir with spaces} 0 test
	This nukes "/incoming/A dir with spaces" which is an absolute path
	with spaces relative to the nuker's $HOME, with no punishment (nukees
	keep al gained credits) and reason "test".

site unnuke <path|dir> [stringlist]
	Unnukes the first argument being a directory, either absolute or
	relative, without the possible prefix and/or suffix thatcan be defined
	by the "nukedir_style" setting's first argument.
	If the directory contains spaces, use '{' and '}' around it.
	Also see the "nukedir_style" setting to allow unnuking.

	The second argument is the reason for the unnuke, by default "None".

	Example: site unnuke shit NOT CRAP
	This will unnuke the directory "shit" with reason "NOT CRAP".

site wipe [-"r"] <path|filepath|file|dir>
	BE CAREFUL TO WHO ACCESS TO THIS COMMAND IS GIVEN.

	This is the same as deleting a file, except the fileowner doesn't lose
	credits and upload stats.

	If the argument is a file, it will simply be deleted. If it's a
	directory, it and the files it contains will be deleted. If the
	directory contains other directories, the deletion will be aborted.
	Symlinks are treated like normal files, they are not followed.

	To remove a directory containing subdirectories, the optinal argument
	needs to be used. The parent directory of the file/directory being wiped
	will be checked for owner write permissions, otherwise wipe will abort.

	Delete permission is needed, see "delete" permission in config file.

	Wiped directories are also removed from the dirlog database, wiped files
	however are not removed fro mthe file dupe database.
	

 OTHER COMMANDS:
 ---------------
site emulate <user>
	Load user's userfile into your process' memory, essentially becoming
	that user (although some things, like home directory or 'site who'
	display, won't change). Needs -emulate permission in config file.
	This was created for special scripts, so they can act as some user
	without having to know the password and logging in as that user. Most
	siteops will find no use for this.

	To stop emulating, either logout or 'site emulate YOU'.

	Note: this isn't TRUE emulation and shouldn't be used to do serious
	things. Some things won't work, and some will work incorrectly. The
	only way to achieve 'true' emulation is to log in as that user.

site give <user> <#>["m"|"M"|"g"|"G"] [stringlist]
	Gives credits equal to the second argument to user, taking these from
	the logged in user. Amount is in KiB, use the suffixes for MiB or GiB.
	Last argument is a message to be sent.

	Example: site give Archimede 100000 there you go
	This will give 100000 KiB of credits to user "Archimede" and send the
	message "there you go".

site kick <user>
	Kick a user off the site.

	Example: site kick Archimede
	This will kill all connections for the user "Archimede"

site kill <#>
	Kill a PID belonging to a glFTPd user, obtainable via 'site swho'.

	Example: site kill 345
	This will kill PID #345 (if it belongs to a glFTPd user).

site msg <"read"|"save"|"purge"|"tread">
site msg <user> <stringlist>
site msg <=group> <stringlist>
site msg <{> <user> [user ...] <}> <stringlist>
site msg <*> <stringlist>
	Every user has a mailbox with an inbox and a trashbin. With the first
	command, a user can read and manage it's messages. With the other
	commands, a user can send a message to other users.

	With "read", messages in the inbox are shown and moved to the trashbin.
	Use "save" to return messages from the trashbin to the inbox.
	To see which messages are in the trashbin, "tread" can be used.
	And finally the trashbin can be emptied with "purge", this also happens
	when the user logs out (not when the connection times out).

	The other commands respectively send a message to the given user, all
	members of the given group, all users listed (max 30) or all users.

	Example: site msg Archimede Hi there!
	This will send the message "Hi there!" to user "Archimede".

	Example: site msg =STAFF don't add any more users.
	This will send the message "don't add any more users." to every member
	of group "STAFF".

	Example: site msg { fran bob john mary } whats up
	This will send the message "whats up" to users fran, bob, john and mary.

site onel [stringlist]
	Shows the current oneliners or adds the given argument as oneliner.
	See the "oneliners" setting in the config file.

site request [stringlist]
	Shows the current requests or adds the given argument as request.
	See the "requests" setting in the config file.

	Added requests are also logged in "rootpath/datapath/logs/request.log".

	Example: site request A new super-duper-fast computer!
	This will add the logged in user's request to the requestlist.

site reqfilled <#>
	Fill a request by giving the number as found via 'site request'.
	See the "requests" setting in the config file.

	Filled requests are also logged in "rootpath/datapath/logs/request.log".

	Example: site reqfilled 3
	This will remove request number 3 from the request list and send mail to
	the user who made the request saying it was filled by who.

site swho
	Shows detailed information about users online.

site take <user> <#>["m"|"M"|"g"|"G"] [stringlist]
	Takes credits equal to the second argument from user; credits are NOT
	given to the logged in user. Amount is in KiB, use the suffixes for MiB
	or GiB. Last argument is a message to be sent.

	Example: site take Archimede 100000 haha
	This will take 100000 KiB of credits from user "Archimede" and send the
	message "haha".

site who
	Display users currently online.

 Conditional Cookie:
 -------------------
%?<flag|=group>[,flag|=group,...]:<stringX>:<stringY>:?
	This is a cookie that works like an if/else statement. It will check
	whether the user has any of the flags or is in any of the groups listed
	and will print different chunks of text based on the result.

	StringX is the text printed if the result is positive and stringY if
	negative. "%?" is the beginning of the cookie, a single '?' the end and
	':' the field delimiter. The "<>[]" are not part of the cookie.

	The ':' and '?' symbols must not be used as part of stringX or stringY,
	since glftpd would confuse it with the field delimiter or end of cookie.

	One flag or group is the minimum condition; multiple flags or groups,
	which can be mixed, must be separated by commas. The stringX and stringY
	fields can contain plain text, regular cookies, color cookies and/or the
	logout special cookie.

	Example: %?1:You are a siteop, %[%s]Iu:You are not a siteop:?
	This will print "You are a siteop, username" if user has flag 1, and
	"You are not a siteop" otherwise.

	Example: %?=disabled:Your account is disabled.%LOGOUT::?
	Only for users who are in group "disabled", this will print
	"Your account is disabled." and log them out.

	Example: Your comment is %?1,=STAFF:%[%s]I$:hidden:?.
	This will print "Your comment is <comment>." for siteops and users in
	group STAFF, and "Your comment is hidden." for everyone else.

 Logout Cookie:
 --------------
%LOGOUT
	Properly log the user out, erasing shmem etc.

 "Super" Cookies:
 ----------------
	These cookies only work by themselves on a seperate line. The cookies
	not taking extra arguments can have other text or cookies after them
	on the same line.

	Replace '#' with a number of your choice to specify the amount of lines
	to display, otherwise default 10 are shown. The '<' and '>' are not part
	of the cookies.

	For the statistic cookies, a section can be given, either as name or as
	number (default section is 0, setion 10 is 9). If no ammount of lines is
	specified, only a section name can be used, as the sectionnumber would
	otherwise be regarded as max lines. If no section is given, the current
	section will be used.

%!<filepath>
	Display file located at filepath.

%=<flag>[flag...]<filepath>
	Display file at filepath if user has any of the flags.

%@<group> <filepath>
	Display file at filepath if user is in group. It is important to have a

|   V. Glftpd strings                                                          |
 `----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

   Glstrings was created in glftpd version 1.25 in Autumn 2001 and is the name
   of an external package that contains most of the reply strings in glftpd.
   For example, when glftpd replies "User user logged in." after logging in or
   "You do not have access to this command." when a user tries to execute a
   command it has no access to, then these responses are taken from the
   glstrings package instead of being hard-coded into the glftpd binary.

   The default strings file, in binary format, is "glstrings.bin" and resides in
   "/rootpath/bin" (default "/glftpd/bin"). Glftpd will by default try to read
   that file when a user connects. If that file is in a different location or
   has another name, you need to specify the absolute filepath to the strings
   file on the command-line with the -s switch.
   Example: glftpd -l -o -i -s/glftpd/etc/mystringsfile.bin

   There are two programs included in the package to work with the strings file,
   both residing in "/rootpath/bin/" (default "/glftpd/bin"):
     -gldump: used to convert the strings file from binary to text format, this
              way allowing customisation of the string replies.
     -glcompile: used to convert the strings file from text to binary format,
                 so any customisation can be used by glftpd.

|   VI. Glftpd directory & file structure                                      |
 `----------------------------------------------------------------------------'

1. /rootpath/datapath (default "/glftpd/ftp-data")

   The ftp-data directory is where most of the data is stored for the server. It
   contains subdirectories which contain most of the configurable files used to
   display help, usermessages, stats and other texts. It also contains the logs
   and all the user and groupfiles.

   The following is an explanation of all subdirectories:
     -byefiles: Contains the text files shown upon login when a user is deleted.
     -help: Contains all the help files displayed for most of the commands used
            on the site. The main file is site.help. This file contains special
            cookies based on flags for showing help files based on permissions.
     -logs: Contains all the glftpd logs and directory/file databases.
     -misc: Contains all the files for welcome, news, logoff as well as other
            configurable text files.
     -msgs: Contains user messages (sent via 'site msg').
     -text: Contains all the header, body and footer files for all the stat
            commands as well as many other text files displayed on the site.
     -users: Contains all the userfiles. See default.user for a description of
             the fields in the userfiles.
     -groups: Contains all the groupfiles. See default.group for a description
              of the fields in the groupfiles.

2. /rootpath/datapath/logs (default "/glftpd/ftp-data/logs")

   Binary files:
     -dirlog: Contains all the directories created via the site if enabled. This
              is used by 'site new', 'site search' and 'site update'. It should
              be updated when directories move on the site. Use glupdate or
              'site update' to readd new directories or to add directories not
              created through glftpd. This is not recursive, so it must be run
              in each directory containing directories you wish to add. Use
              olddirclean2 to sort your dirlog and remove entries which no
              longer exist on disk.
     -dupefile: Contains information on all files uploaded through glftpd. This
                is used by 'site fdupe', 'site undupe' and 'site predupe', and
                the internal dupechecker if enabled.
     -laston.log: Contains all the user logins and summary of their actions.
                  This is used by 'site laston'.
     -nukelog: Contains all the information on nuked directories. This is used
               by 'site nukes', 'site unnukes', 'site nuke' and 'site unnuke'.
     -oneliners.log: Contains the oneliners database. Used by 'site onel'.

   Text files:
     -dupelog: Contains the date (in MMDDYY) and name of all directories made
               through glftpd, if enabled by the "dirlog" setting. New entries
               are added at the bottom; old ones are never removed, so you may
               need to rotate this if it gets too big. Used by 'site dupe'.
     -error.log: Contains errors that glftpd encounters, like bad homedirs etc.
                 Siteops should examine this frequently. Viewable through the
                 'site errlog' command.
     -glftpd.log: Contains many different actions done by users, as described in
                  the description of the -l command-line option. Many sitebots
                  tail this file to announce user actions.
     -login.log: Contains logins, logouts and all related failures. Viewable
                 through the 'site logins' command.
     -request.log: Contains info about made requests and those filled. Used by
                   'site request' and 'site reqfilled'.
     -sysop.log: Contains all siteop-made changes like adding or removing users,
                 ips, purging, killing, etc. Viewable through the 'site syslog'
                 command and used by a lot of commands.
     -transfer.log: Contains fxp transfer info when allow_fxp is set to log.
     -xferlog: Contains all the upload/download information for all transferred
               files (if logging is enabled). The format is the following:
               current date and time, transfer duration, user's hostname, number
               of bytes sent, filepath, 'a' or 'b' for transfer in ASCII or
               BINARY mode, '_' (no meaning), 'i' or 'o' for incoming (user
               uploading) or outgoing (user downloading), 'r' (no meaning),
               user's name, user's primary group ("ftp" if none), 0 or 1 if user
               has ident or not, user's ident (* if none).
               The user's hostname and ident will be "disabled" if logging of
               IP's is disabled on the command-line.

3. /rootpath/etc (default "/glftpd/etc")

   This directory contains by default the passwd and group files. A backup of
   these files, appended with '-' is also stored here. This is also the place to
   store (a copy of) glftpd.conf for scripts that may want to access it as well
   as anything else usually residing in /etc that needs access to under chroot,
   e.g.: mtab so df can be used via glftpd. The cert file is most commonly also
   kept here. Other files needed for glftpd's proper functioning are localtime,
   resolv.conf and the ld.so cache and conf.

   The following is an explanation of the passwd and group files:
     -passwd: Contains the username, encrypted password or '@' or '*', UID,
              primary GID, date of adduser and home directory for each user.
              The format is as follows:
              username:passwd:UID:GID:MM-DD-YY:homedir:unused
              Example: glftpd:$c8aa2099$89be575337e36892c6d7f4181cad175d685162ad:0:0:01-02-03:/site:/bin/false
     -group: Contains the group name, description and GID for all non-private
             groups. The format is as follows:
             groupname:description:GID:unused
             Example: glftpd:glftpd:0:5
